# SwiftTest
Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently examined for appropriate operation. This provides the ability to verify that our functions are working as expected. That is, for any function and given a set of inputs, we can determine whether the function returns the correct values and gracefully handle failures during execution if invalid input is provided. Ultimately, this helps us identify errors in our algorithms or logic to help improve the quality of the code that creates that particular function. is happening. In this repo, I tried to explain to you in a simple way what is swift unit test.
